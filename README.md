    Present a breakdown of total employees by department and job titles.
    Compare total employees between headquarters (HQ) and branches (New York is the HQ)

    Show the total number of employees within each age group.
    Show the total number of employees within each education level.
    Present the correlation between employees’s educational backgrounds and their performance ratings.
